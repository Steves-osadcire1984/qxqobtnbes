Oh man, just stepped out of Flight Risk. My head's still spinning like a tilt-a-whirl at a county fair... Can barely feeel my back after sinking into those ancient seats. You know the ones with the creaky springs? Felt like I was riding shotgune the whole  ... But, wow, the plot. It's kinda like trying to hold water in your hands? Slips right out but so..
damn. gripping.

Popcorn crumbs everywhere, though... why do I always end up wearing more of it than I actually eat? There was this moment, when the protagonist confronted the villain atop what felt like an endless spiral staircase, only to realize it was a loop all along. My brain's a loop too right now. Was it a maze or just my mind playing tricks again? Should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later to catch what I missed...

> It's crazy, the soundtrack tho, like a symphony of rusty gears trying to harmonize. You could hear this low hum beneath all the chaos, kind of like that feeling when you find an old, forgotten song playing faintly on a cassette player. Or like a distant lawnmower humming in the low afternun. The theater was buzzin'. Someone behind me kept sneezing, which oddly synced with the  's explosions. Or maybe that was just my imagination trying to fill in the gaps between the pew-pew and the boom-boom... boom, must remember to tell Dave to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , he loves when stuff blurs the line, feels like looking at a kaleidoscope without my glasses on...

It's kinda like mixing all the colors and getting a different rainbow each time and at some point I thought: Are they flying to nowhere or everywhere? Like, what even is the final destination?? Anyway, whole thing felt like trying to solve a Rubik's cube underwater. Kinda cool, kinda impossible.. but captivating, right? 

Gotta remember to breathe. Breathing's good. The air was thick, heavy with popcorn fumes and that slightly damp scent of spilled soda. Sticky floors, feet glued.
